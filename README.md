# pagekit-template-generator

Right now Pagekit does not have it set up where 3rd party modules can register commands, hopefully the pull request I've made will get merged soon though! [Go and show your support for it if you want.](https://github.com/pagekit/pagekit/pull/703)

I would like to eventually have this project able to handle things like widgets and vue components, but right now it just handles pagekit extensions.

`php pagekit generate module {{ vendor_name }} {{ module_name }}`
